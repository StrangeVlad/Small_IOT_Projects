# What is LoRaWAN?

LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a wireless communication protocol designed for low-power devices to send small amounts of data over long distances. It is commonly used in IoT (Internet of Things) applications like smart agriculture, environmental monitoring, and industrial automation.

# How Does It Work?

- Sensor Device (Node): A small device with sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity) sends data using LoRa.
- LoRa Gateway: Receives data from multiple sensor nodes and forwards it to the internet.
- Network Server: Processes data and sends it to applications.
- User Application: The final data is displayed in a dashboard, app, or database.

# Why Use LoRaWAN?

- Long Range: Can send data over kilometers (even 10+ km in open areas).
- Low Power: Devices can run for years on batteries.
- Low Cost: No need for SIM cards or expensive networks.
- Supports Many Devices: A single gateway can handle thousands of nodes.
