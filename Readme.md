# IoT + LoRaWAN + Arduino + Machine Learning Experiments 🚀

This repository contains a collection of experiments combining **IoT technologies**, **LoRaWAN simulation**, **Arduino projects**, and a small **machine learning algorithm** using an IoT dataset.

## 🔧 What I Worked On

### 1. Arduino Simulation 🧰

- Tested basic and intermediate Arduino projects.
- Simulated circuits using platforms like Tinkercad and Proteus.
- Projects included sensor readings, serial communication, and actuator control.

### 2. LoRaWAN Testing 📡

- Simulated LoRaWAN communication virtually.
- Experimented with node-to-gateway interactions and data transmission.
- Evaluated range, frequency, and payload characteristics.

### 3. Machine Learning on IoT Dataset 📊🤖

- Collected and preprocessed a small IoT dataset.
- Applied a basic machine learning algorithm (e.g., logistic regression or decision tree).
- Focused on predictions such as device behavior or sensor classification.

## 🧪 Tools & Technologies
